- 👋 Hi, I’m Clotilde Arléry,
- 👀 I’m interested in political sciences (!!!), social sciences in general (philosophy (!), history (!), sociology (!), psychology, political sciences (!), informatics (cybersecurity & prog). When  I want something, I get it : I wanted a website : I got it ! I learnt html, css, javascript, python, php and MySql in three months. I've built, by my self, my own website with many different programming languages. These languages were html, css, javascript (frontend part) and PHP & MySql (backend part). I created this site from "a" to "z" and I learnt a lot about programming. I've also coded a website for a friend and old teacher with 3d in it !! Visit it (!!!): chimphyz.But... Most of all, I discovered philosophy (!!!) and economy before,in second grade(!!!)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... political science, Three.js, c++, economy ;-)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...I don't know for now !
